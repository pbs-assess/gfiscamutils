\arguments{
\item{models}{A list of iscam model objects}

\item{model_names}{Names to use for the models in the plots. The names of
the list items in `models` will be used if they are present and this will
be ignored. If the list item names are not defined, temporary names will be used
(Temporary model 1, Temporary model 2, etc.)}

\item{type}{Either 'sbt' for Spawning biomass or 'rt' for Recruitment}

\item{rel}{Logical. Make plot relative to initial estimate (B0 or R0 depending
on the choice for `type`}

\item{show_initial}{Logical. If `TRUE` and `rel == FALSE`, show the initial value
on the plot (either B0 or R0)}

\item{legend_title}{Title for legend}

\item{xlim}{The x limits for the plot. If `NULL`, the limits of the data
will be used}

\item{ylim}{The y limits for the plot. If `NULL`, the limits of the data
will be used}

\item{line_width}{Width of all median lines on the plot}

\item{point_size}{Point size for all median points on the plot}

\item{line_ribbon}{Logical. If `TRUE`, make the first model plotted an envelope
of the credible interval, surrounding the median line}

\item{refpts_ribbon}{Logical. If `TRUE`, make the first model's reference points lines
(`show_bo_lines` and/or `show_bmsy_lines` must be `TRUE`) plotted an envelope
of the credible interval, surrounding the median lines for the reference points}

\item{alpha}{The opacity between 0 to 1 of the envelope shown when `line_ribbon == TRUE`}

\item{refpts_alpha}{The opacity between 0 to 1 of the envelope shown for referece points
when `refpts_ribbon == TRUE` and `show_bo_lines` and/or `show_bmsy_lines` are `TRUE`}

\item{offset}{The amount on the x-axis to offset each point and line for
multiple models. Used for recruitment plots}

\item{bo_dodge}{The amount to offset the initial value (B0 or R0) values from each
other so the values and uncertainty can be easily seen for multiple models}

\item{x_space}{The amount of x-interval space to pad the left and right of the plot
with. To remove all padding, make this 0}

\item{append_base_txt}{Text to append to the first model's name for display on the
plot legend}

\item{show_bo_lines}{Show the B0 lines (0.2 and 0.4 B0) for the first model}

\item{show_bmsy_lines}{Show the Bmsy lines (0.4 and 0.8 Bmsy) for the first model}

\item{ind_letter}{A letter to place in the upper left corner of the plot. If `NULL`,
nothing will be shown}

\item{probs}{A 3-element vector of probabilities that appear in the output data frames
This is provided in case the data frames have more than three different quantile levels}

\item{...}{Other graphical arguments}

\item{leg}{A vector of two values representing the X/Y coordinates inside the plot to
place the legend. If `NULL`, the default placement is used}

Nothing
