\arguments{
\item{models}{A list of iscam model objects (class [mdl_lst_cls])}

\item{model_names}{Names to use for the models in the plots. The names of
the list items in `models` will be used if they are present and this will
be ignored. If the list item names are not defined, temporary names will be used}

\item{surv_index}{The `survey_index` data frame which is the `dat` object in the output
from the [read_data_file()] function}

\item{gear}{A vector of gear numbers to show. If `NULL`, all will be shown}

\item{start_year}{Year to start plot}

\item{end_year}{Year to end plot}

\item{legend_title}{Title text for the legend}

\item{palette}{A palette value that is in [RColorBrewer::brewer.pal.info]}

\item{base_color}{A color to prepend to the brewer colors which are set by `palette`.
This is called `base_color` because it is likely to be a base model}

\item{dodge}{A small value added to each year for each model. This is added cumulatively,
so each model fit appears more to the right than the previous one}

\item{index_line_width}{The index data error bar and connecting line width}

\item{index_point_size}{The index data point size}

\item{index_color}{The color used for the observed index lines and points}

\item{fit_line_width}{The model fit error bar and connecting line width}

\item{fit_point_size}{The model fit point size}

\item{errbar_width}{The width of the top and bottom crossbar of the errorbars}

\item{angle_x_labels}{If `TRUE` put 45 degree angle on x-axis tick labels}
